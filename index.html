                I'm an 18yr that likes to spend most of his time doing these 3 things <br>
                for the most part I like to play VideoGames and watch anime, sometimes I play videogames about an anime
                ðŸ¤£<br>
                but the thing that I do the most is play VideoGames then in second place Anime and in third I like to
                watch movies <br>
                all kinds of movies not horror tho I get scared pretty easly, I prefer movies about VideoGames or Anime
                <br>
